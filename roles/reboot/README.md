# Role: reboot

Reboots the host if a reboot is needed.

Any other role can signal that a reboot should be performed by simply creating a `/etc/ansible/reboot` file.

```
touch /etc/ansible/reboot
```

If the `/etc/ansible/reboot` file exists when this role executes then the role will not check the state of the host to determine if it needs a reboot or not.  It will simply reboot
the node.

If the `/etc/ansible/reboot` file does not exist then the role will check to see if the host needs a reboot.  The method for determining if a reboot is needed is different depending on the OS.

To prevent this role from rebooting the host regardless of the
existence of a `/etc/ansible/reboot` file or if the host needs a reboot, set

```
reboot_disable: yes
```
